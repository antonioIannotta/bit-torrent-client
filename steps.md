# Steps to implement BitTorrent Client

* Develop a Bencoding parser to extract the information from the .torrent file
* Retrieve the tracker URL from the decoded .torrent file
* Retrieve file information
* Determine the size of each piece of file
* Calculate the SHA-1 hash of the info dictionary in the .torrent file. This hash is used to uniquely identify the torrent and is crucial for validating downloaded pieces.
* With the tracker URL and file information in hand, your client can now start the process of connecting to the tracker, obtaining a list of peers, and initiating peer-to-peer communication for file sharing.
